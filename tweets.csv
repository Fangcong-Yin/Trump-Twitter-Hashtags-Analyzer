Their is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs which take effect on China today. This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S. 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree. Also the Tariffs can be.....,05-13-2019 10:40:25,11309,49347
....completely avoided if you by from a non-Tariffed Country or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). That‚Äôs Zero Tariffs.
